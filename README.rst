Riskeyboard 70 Firmware
=======================
This repository contains the super duper alpha code for the Riskeyboard 70: An analog hall effect keyboard that uses 3D printed switches and stabilizers.  It also has the ability to use a MAX7219 display with up to 8 matrices, an infrared receiver (e.g. TSOP382), and relay boards to provide super duper clicky feedback.

The Riskeyboard 70 also features an analog rotary encoder and is (currently) built using `Keyberon <https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon>`_.
